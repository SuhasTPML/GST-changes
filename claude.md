# GST Interactive Development Guidelines

## Code Development Protocol

### Use Codex MCP for All Code Changes
- **All code reading**: Use codex MCP server to analyze and understand existing code
- **All code modifications**: Use codex MCP server to implement changes, fixes, and new features
- **Code reviews**: Use codex for comprehensive code analysis and suggestions
- **File operations**: Prefer codex for reading, editing, and creating code files

### Git Workflow
- **Commit frequently**: Suggest git commits whenever major changes are completed
- **Descriptive messages**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages that explain the changes
- **Push after commits**: Push changes to remote repository after committing
- **Track progress**: Major feature implementations should be committed as logical units
